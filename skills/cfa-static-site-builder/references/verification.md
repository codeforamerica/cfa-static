# Verification

Read this reference before declaring a CfA Static site task complete. Run
commands from the repository root.

## Validation Loop

1. Make one coherent group of changes.
2. Run the narrowest relevant check.
3. Fix the source of every failure; do not add fallbacks or exclusions to hide
   invalid content.
4. Build and inspect the affected routes.
5. Run the final checks once the implementation is stable.

## Command Matrix

| Change | During iteration | Before handoff |
|---|---|---|
| Content or site data | `npm run build` | `npm run build`, `npm run check:a11y` |
| Theme or SCSS | targeted build/SCSS test | `npm run build`, `npm run lint:scss`, `npm run check:a11y` |
| Frontend JavaScript | targeted Vitest file | `npm test` |
| Eleventy, collections, config, media | targeted unit/integration tests | `npm test` |
| Block schema/template | targeted block tests plus generators | `npm test` |
| CMS generator | targeted CMS tests plus artifact generation | `npm test` |
| Deployment/path behavior | path-prefix integration test | `npm test`, production build |

Use targeted Vitest commands while iterating:

```bash
npx vitest run test/unit/path/to/feature.test.js
npx vitest run test/integration/eleventy/path-prefix.test.js
```

Run the full suite only once at the end of broad or code-level work:

```bash
npm test
```

## Generated Artifacts

After changing schemas or other generated-reference inputs, regenerate all
references and CMS artifacts:

```bash
npm run generate-references
```

Its three steps generate the block reference, PagesCMS config plus CMS types,
and developer reference in order, stopping on failure. CMS artifacts use the saved
`cms_config`; the command does not change the selected collections or features.
Individual generator commands remain available for focused work.

The block generator owns `references/blocks.md` inside this skill, not
`BLOCKS_LAYOUT.md` or the authored `layouts.md` companion. The developer
reference derives from package commands, Biome configuration, FP exports, Sass,
CMS definitions, and deployment workflows.

Freshness checks compare generated content without rewriting either reference.
Precommit does not regenerate stale artifacts; regenerate and re-stage them
before retrying. Skill packaging checks validate metadata, links, and evaluation
definitions; they do not run an agent against the evaluation scenarios or prove
task success.

Never repair generated output by hand. Change its source schema or saved
`cms_config`, regenerate, and inspect the diff.

## Build And Accessibility

`npm run build` clears and writes `_site/`, runs Pagefind, and checks internal
links. A successful process is necessary but not sufficient.

Then run:

```bash
npm run check:a11y
```

This audits every built page against WCAG 2.2 AA rules that axe can evaluate.
Manually review qualities automation cannot settle: color contrast in rendered
themes, keyboard flow, image meaning, content clarity, and responsive layout.

## Inspect The Output

For each affected route, verify:

- exactly one appropriate H1 and a logical heading sequence
- primary navigation and breadcrumbs point to the intended routes
- internal links and assets include the correct project prefix when applicable
- images have useful alt text, dimensions, and responsive sources
- calls to action are accurate and not duplicated excessively
- empty news/guide/listing states do not leave misleading copy or broken grids
- title, description, canonical URL, hreflang, and schema metadata are factual
- mobile content order remains meaningful

Use the development server or built HTML as appropriate. If screenshots are
enabled, inspect them rather than treating capture success as visual approval.

## Project-Path Check

When deployment is a GitHub Pages project site or another subpath, rely on the
existing integration test. For an extra production smoke test, use a valid
public site base URL with no trailing slash:

```bash
PATH_PREFIX=/project/ SITE_URL=https://site.invalid/project npm run build
```

Check representative HTML, feed, search, redirect, image, font, canonical, and
schema URLs for exactly one `/project/` prefix.

## Failure Triage

- **Placeholder site data:** replace or remove the reported publishable value;
  do not weaken `scripts/site-data.js`.
- **Unknown block/key:** compare the content with [the block reference](blocks.md) and the
  schema module named by the block.
- **Missing required field:** add factual content or choose a block that does
  not require that field.
- **Missing download/image:** fix the source path and passthrough configuration.
- **Internal link failure:** correct the source route or preserve the old route
  with a redirect.
- **Generated freshness failure:** regenerate from the schema or saved CMS
  configuration.
- **Accessibility failure:** fix the rendered semantic cause, then rerun the
  audit across the whole site.

## Handoff Evidence

State exactly which commands ran and whether they passed. If a useful check was
not run, say why. Identify content, design, translation, privacy, or deployment
decisions that still need a human; do not imply automated checks reviewed them.
