      # How a page gets built

      From a markdown file with YAML frontmatter to a validated, rendered, deployable static page - here's the whole pipeline.

      ## Pages are lists of blocks

      Every page is a markdown file whose frontmatter declares a `blocks`
      array. Each entry has a `type` plus that block's fields - the full
      vocabulary is on the [blocks page](/blocks/), with live previews where
      a meaningful standalone preview is possible.
    figure_filename: src/pages/example.md
    figure_language: yaml
    figure_code: "---\nname: Example\npermalink: /example/\nblocks:\n  - type: hero\n    content: |\n      # Hello\n  - type: markdown\n    content: Body text here.\n---"
  - type: split-code

      ## The build checks every block

      Unknown block types, unknown top-level keys, and missing required
      values fail the build with an error naming the file and the block.
      Nested validation does not catch every unknown or mistyped child
      field, so compare nested entries with the schema and inspect the output.
      The same schemas generate the editor config and reference docs;
      tests check that those generated files stay current.
    reverse: true
    figure_filename: terminal
    figure_language: text
    figure_code: "Unknown block type \"herro\" (block 1 in ./src/pages/example.md).\nValid types: ..."

      ## One command, one directory

      Eleventy renders every page, processes images into responsive
      formats, bundles CSS and JS, builds the search index, and checks
      every internal link. The result is a plain `_site/` directory.
    figure_filename: terminal
    figure_language: bash
    figure_code: "npm run build\n# -> _site/\n#    index.html, blocks/, guide/, news/ ...\n#    css/, assets/, images/, pagefind/"

      ## Push to deploy

      A GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes the site to GitHub
      Pages on every push to `main` - project subpaths and custom domains
      both work without editing anything. `_site/` is also uploaded as a
      build artifact, so any other static host can serve it instead.
    reverse: true
    figure_filename: .github/workflows/pages.yml
    figure_language: yaml
    figure_code: "- name: Build Site\n  env:\n    PATH_PREFIX: ${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}/\n    SITE_URL: ${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}\n  run: npm run build"

      ## Explore the blocks

      The blocks page pairs standalone previews with their YAML examples.
      Collection-restricted blocks show usage guidance instead of a preview.
